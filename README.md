NOCLibrary is a library that provides frequently used functions in Objective-C projects.


## Installation

You can install it using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), the project dependency management tool using Objective-C and Swift.

### Installation with CocoaPods
To inject a NOCLibrary dependency into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, add NOCLibrary in the Podfile.

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'YourProjectName' do
  pod 'NOCLibrary', '~> 1.0'
end
```

If you are already using a Podfile, you only need to add the NOCLibrary dependency.

```ruby
pod 'NOCLibrary', '~> 1.0'
```

If the NOCLibrary dependency is added to the Podfile, execute the following command.
```bash
$ pod install
```
